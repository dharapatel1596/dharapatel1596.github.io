| | During my masters I got an opportunity to work as a working student with BTG Feldberg & Sohn GmbH & Co. KG. My task was to develop robotic system using PLC programming. This system was set to sort the EUR pallets according to their quality, weather the pallet is new, normal, or defective pallet. The main PLC programming software used was TwinCAT3. Another task was to use company database to store the state of the robot and its surrounding. The state of the robot consisted of its current position and orientation. The robot surrounding consisted of status of the pallet quality, light curtain status and total number of pallets scanned. |

| | As a part of my master thesis, the task was to implement robotic software system for an exisitng internal process. For that evaluation of the exising process and research about available robot programming approaches have been done. After evaluating each programming approach, best approach for programming the robot has been selected. The selection was made according to the requirements for a robot operated order picking and placing process. The selected approach was Robot Operating System (ROS). Further programming development was done using python with ROS. The first protoype has been developed in the ROS simulation with integration of industrial robot (ABB), real camera, order data coming from company database and safety features. |
