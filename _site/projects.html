The controller used in this robot was Raspberry pi and the camera used for face recognition was Pi-camera. The physical model of a robot was a miniature humanoid robot with which was controller with servo motors. A python program has been developed using built-in face recognition libraries, so that the robot makes a small dance move whenever a person is infront of the robot. It was a real nice get to know project of robotic systems during studies.</td>

      <td>In this bachelor thesis, machinability analysis of a maraging steel (AISI Grade 250) has been carried out. The experiment setup consisted of maraging steel rod, K-type thermometer, arduino Uno, and surface roughness tester. In the turning operation with varying speed, feed and depth of cut in CNC machine, the data about surface roughness and temperature of the rod has been measured. This data was used to train artifical neural network (ANN) for predicting surface roughness and temperature for any combination of speed, feed and depth of cut. The accuracy of model was found to be +/- 2% for the surface roughness and for the temperature +/- 1%.</td>
