This system was set to sort the EUR pallets according to their quality, weather the pallet is new, normal, or defective pallet. The main PLC programming software used was TwinCAT3. Another task was to use company database to store the state of the robot and its surrounding. The state of the robot consisted of its current position and orientation. The robot surrounding consisted of status of the pallet quality, light curtain status and total number of pallets scanned.</td>

For that evaluation of the exising process and research about available robot programming approaches have been done. After evaluating each programming approach, best approach for programming the robot has been selected. The selection was made according to the requirements for a robot operated order picking and placing process. The selected approach was Robot Operating System (ROS). Further programming development was done using python with ROS. The first protoype has been developed in the ROS simulation with integration of industrial robot (ABB), real camera, order data coming from company database and safety features.</td>
