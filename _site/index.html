<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right:100px; text-align: justify" class="fade-in-image">I am Dharaben Patel, from India would like to introduce myself.
This website lets you go through my profile.
I have been in Germany since 2019. 
The reason I came to Germany was to study masters.
But why Germany and not any other country?
Well, there are many reasons behind that. 
The important reason is the quality of education provided in very economical way. 
And second main reason is tremendous oppurtunities in robotics available. 
As I wanted to go in Robotics &amp; Automation area in future. 
I have first done my bachelors in Mechatronics from India and then applied in Germany to do masters also in Mechatronics. 
And yes, I got admission in University Duisburg-Essen for masters in Mechatronics. 
And I have started my journey in Germany!</p>

<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right:100px; text-align: justify" class="fade-in-image">While studying I found my niche in Robotics &amp; Automation.
Therefore in my career I want to be in the same field.
I have two motivations to pursue my career in this field.
My first motivation is that I want to help companies improve their existing processes.
Some of the internal processes in companies are monotonuous, dangerous and more error prone.
Certain processes needs to be done more efficiently and with fast pace so that, throughput of the system can be increased.
Such processes can be improved by using robotic systems.
Robotic systems can automate part or full process and in the end improve system throughput.
The second motivation for choosing this field that as a woman I want to encourage others to pursue their career in Robotics.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right:100px; text-align: justify" class="fade-in-image">We can discuss more about my profile in the personal interview :)</p>
